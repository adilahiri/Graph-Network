!Series_summary	"We applied the tiling arrays to study RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR)-mediated expression under drought stress condition."
!Series_overall_design	"The total RNA was prepared from 14-day-old Arabidopsis plants  grown on the agar plates and used for the microarray hybridization. Three replicative hybridization experiments for each strand array were carried out using the independent biological RNA samples of drought-treated condition and untreated condition."
